I am Franz Meinard N. Chang of BSIT2-B1. In this assignment Drill, I'm tasked to make enhancements to his base code from my prof, which is a Guessing Game. I added new features to the code such as User/Client, Difficulties from Easy to Hard, and Implementing a Scoring system. He also required the server to save the user's name and score of the chosen difficulty. I am not much of a programmer, but I did my best to ensure to finish this and watched a lot of tutorial videos on how to do it. This is my submission for the lab assignment, and this is my submission for Enhancing the Guessing Game using sockets.

-Enjoy
